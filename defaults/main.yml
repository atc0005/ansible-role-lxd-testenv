# See Docker storage drivers for valid options, BUT know that some may not
# work within a LXD/LXD environment. The default value chosen here is 'vfs' in
# order to provide the broadest compatibility with backing storage filesystems,
# but this default option should be overridden by the role user if performance
# is found to not be sufficient. Aside from 'vfs', the 'overlay' Docker storage
# driver has been found to be compatible, provided that:
#
# * you are not using ZFS as the the LXD storage option
# * if using docker-ce 18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial and LXD 3.0.3 the overlay
#   kernel module is loaded by the LXD container profile
#
# AFAIK, no special changes are needed to use the 'overlay' Docker storage
# driver with docker-ce 18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial and LXD LTS 2.0.x provided
# with Ubuntu 16.04.
